Assessment: Weekly Exercise #5: Matrix Class

Included Files:
    * matrix.cpp
    * we5_test.cpp
    * matrix.h
    * matrix_class.sh
    * README
    * Makefile
        Makefile Targets:
            - make (we5_solution): Builds the executable we5_solution
            - make clean: Removes all object files and the executable
            - make matrix.o: Builds the object file for matrix.cpp
            - make we5_test.o: Builds the object file for we5_test.cpp

Running instructions: 
        In the directory (named, "soln") containing the files matrix.cpp, we5_test.cpp, matrix.h,
    matrix_class.sh and a custom Makefile with the TestCentre Makefile in the parent directory (also containing the 
    test cases that the submission needs to be tested upon), use the command "make". This will feed the test cases
    to the program one after the other and provide feedback whether the program passes it or not. Use the command
    "make clean" to remove all object files and the executable while in the "soln" directory.

Notes and Assumptions:
        The file we5_test.cpp, which is the driver file, is completely unchanged. So is the file and matrix_class.sh. The
    file matrix.cpp contains the implementation of the class methods of the class Matrix. In order to manually provide
    input for the program, run the command "make (we3_soltution)" in the "soln" directory. This will create the
    executable in the same directory which can be run with "./we5_solutiion". The user will now be prompted for input. The
    user must adhere to the driver file commands, provided in the exercise description, to test the Matrix class methods
    manually.
        
        For the program to run as expected, the inputs fed to the program must adhere to the specifications provided in
    the exercise description.
