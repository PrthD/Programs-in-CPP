Assessment: Weekly Exercise #3: Reference Manager

Included Files:
    * ref_manager.cpp
    * we3_test.cpp
    * ref_manager.h
    * ref_manager.sh
    * README
    * Makefile
        Makefile Targets:
            - make (we3_solution): Builds the executable we3_solution
            - make clean: Removes all object files and executables
            - make ref_manager.o: Builds the object file for ref_manager.cpp
            - make we3_test.o: Builds the object file for we3_test.cpp

Running instructions: 
        In the directory (named, "soln") containing the files ref_manager.cpp, we3_test.cpp, ref_manager.h,
    ref_manager.sh and a custom Makefile with the TestCentre Makefile in the parent directory (also containing the 
    test cases that the submission needs to be tested upon), use the command "make". This will feed the test cases
    to the program one after the other and provide feedback whether the program passes or not. Use the command
    "make clean" to remove all object files and executables while in the "soln" directory.

Notes and Assumptions:
        The file ref_manager.h containing the definition of the ReferenceManager class is completely unchanged. So
    are the files we3_test.cpp and ref_manager.sh. The file ref_manager.cpp contains the implementation of the
    class methods of the class ReferenceManager. In order to manually provide input for the program, run the
    command "make (we3_soltution)" in the "soln" directory. This will create the executable in the same directory
    which can be run with "./we3_solutiion". The user will now be prompted for input.
        
        For the program to run as expected, the inputs fed to the program must adhere to the specifications
    provided in the exercise description.
