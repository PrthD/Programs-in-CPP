    Description: This method makes the pointer at "ptrIndex" in the "pointers"
                 array reference newAddr. It also supports reassignment to NULL in
                 the case when newAddr is NULL. In addition to doing this, the
                 reference counts are updated in the unordered map "refCount".
                 If this causes a stringâ€™s reference count to fall to 0 (i.e.,
                 no pointers in the pointers array reference it) then the string
                 is added to the "garbage" array, to be deleted the next time
                 garbage collection is requested.

    Arguments:
        ptrIndex (unsigned int): the pointer index in the "pointers" array at
                                 which the pointer needs to reassigned.

        newAddr (const char): the new address with which the pointer at index
                              ptrIndex needs to be reassigned with. 

    This class method returns nothing.

                 uses the method reassignPointer() to have the pointer at index
                 "ptrIndex" reference the newly allocated string.

    Arguments:
        ptrIndex (unsigned int): the pointer index in the "pointers" array at
                                 which the pointer needs to reassigned.
