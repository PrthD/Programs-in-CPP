Assessment: Weekly Exercise #2 - Idols

Included Files:
    * idols.cpp
    * idols.sh
    * README

Running instructions: 
        In a directory (namely, "soln") containing the files idols.cpp, idols.sh, and a Makefile with all the
    test cases that the submission needs to be tested upon, use the command "make". This will feed the test cases
    to the program one after the other and provide feedback whether the submitted program passed it or not.

Notes and Assumptions:
        The file idols.cpp contains a function called reverse which takes two pointers (pointing to two integer
    entries of an array) as input arguments and reverses all entries between these pointers including the entry
    pointed to by "begin" but not the entry pointed to by "end".

        In accordance to the input specification provided in the description of the exercise, the program may take
    greater lengths of time IF the first line of input exceeds the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 or may even fail to
    provide an output.
