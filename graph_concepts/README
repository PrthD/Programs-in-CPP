Assessment: Weekly Exercise #6: Graph Concepts

Included Files:
    * graph_concepts.cpp
    * digraph.cpp
    * digraph.h
    * edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
    * README
    * Makefile
        Makefile Targets:
            - make (we6_solution): Builds the executable we6_solution
            - make clean: Removes all object files and the executable
            - make graph_concepts.o: Builds the object file for graph_concepts.cpp
            - make digraph.o: Builds the object file for digraph.cpp

Running instructions: 
        In the directory (named, "soln") containing the files graph_concepts.cpp, digraph.cpp, digraph.h, edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt and a
    custom Makefile, use the command "make". This will create the executable "we6_solution" in the "soln" directory. In order to redirect
    the input to the program from the text file "edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt", run "./we6_solution < edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt" in the same
    "soln" directory. Use the command "make clean" to remove all object files and the executable while in the "soln" directory.

Notes and Assumptions:
        The files digraph.cpp, digraph.h, and edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt are completely unchanged. The file graph_concepts.cpp contains the
    codes for all tasks of the exercise. In order to manually provide input for the program, run the command "make" in the "soln"
    directory. This will create the executable in the same directory which can be run with "./we6_solution". The user will now be
    prompted for input. The user must adhere to the input format, provided in the exercise description, to test the program manually.
        
        The "depth_first_search(const Digraph &graph, const int u, const int prev, unordered_map<int, int> &visited)" function (for Task
    1) of the file graph_concepts.cpp is implemented from the Lecture 13 of the in-class discussion.
