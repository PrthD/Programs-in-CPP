Assessment: Weekly Exercise #7: Divide and Conquer

Included Files:
    * climbing.cpp
    * README
    * Makefile
        Makefile Targets:
            - make (we7_solution or all): Builds the executable we7_solution
            - make clean: Removes all object files and the executable
            - make climbing.o: Builds the object file for climbing.cpp

Running instructions: 
        In the parent directory containing the originally provided Makefile, run "make" to initiate the automated testing of
    the program.

Notes and Assumptions:
        All the files (except climbing.cpp) originally provided via GitHub Classroom are completely unchanged. The file
    climbing.cpp contains the codes for alll tasks of the exercise.
    
        In order to manually provide input for the program, run the command "make (we7_solution)" in the "soln" directory.
    This will create the executable in the same directory which can be run with "./we7_solution". The user will now be
    prompted for input. The user must adhere to the input format provided in the exercise description for the program to run
    as expected. Use the command "make clean" to remove all object files and the executable while in the "soln" directory.
