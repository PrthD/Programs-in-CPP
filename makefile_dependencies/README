Assessment: Weekly Exercise #7: Interview Question (Makefile Dependencies)

Included Files:
    * makefile_dependencies.cpp
    * README

Running instructions: 
        In the parent directory containing the originally provided Makefile, run the command "make". This will initiate the
    automated testing of the program.

Notes and Assumptions:
        All the files (except makefile_dependencies.cpp) originally provided via GitHub Classroom are completely unchanged.
    The file makefile_dependencies.cpp contains the solution for this exercise.

        The function buildTargets(string target, unordered_map<string, vector<string>> &makefile, unordered_set<string> &built,
    vector<string> &result) in the file makefile_dependencies.cpp is an implementation of the Depth-First-Search Algorithm (DFS).
